Domain: Car dealership
Interface: Console
Platform: .NET
Language: C#

Inputs: carInfo.JSON stored in the root directory. 

For the purpose of this project I have to assume the input is the correct format from user. Normally I would build a GUI or Web interface, but due to time contraints on my end today, I did not have time for that. 

To use the project, you need to install newtonsoft json through Nuget.
